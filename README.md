# Wi-fi based Indoor Positioning System

An Android prototype app written in Java.

The app can use a Wi-fi network with two or more access points to create an Indoor Positioning System based on Wifi Triangulation.

The ideia is quite similar to GPS Positioning System: the app receives the signal of 3 or more Wi-fi access points and uses its powers to calculate user current location.

This prototype also allows to generate wi-fi statistics, which are needed to determine locations.

The app can export this data gathered by the user in ics format, and future versions of it must be able to import this data. This way, users will be able to share their Networks Positioning Systems.

App made by 3 brazilian friends as an one semester project (S3 project) in Telecom Bretagne master degree.
